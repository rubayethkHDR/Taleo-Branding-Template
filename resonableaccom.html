    <p>
        <p> Federal law requires employers to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities. 
            Please tell us if you require a reasonable accommodation to apply for a job or to perform your job. 
            Examples of reasonable accommodation include making a change to the application process or work procedures, providing documents in an alternate format, 
            using a sign language interpreter, or using specialized equipment.</p>
